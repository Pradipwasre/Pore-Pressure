# Pore-Pressure
Pore pressure prediction is a very important area in oil and gas exploration and production and it is done in all basins of the world where exploration wells are drilled for hydrocarbon. Sudden changes in pore pressure when drilling a well and well stability can cause major problems when one is unprepared.
